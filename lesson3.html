											<h3>Activity Name: Design Solutions - Infographic Advertisement</h3>
											<p>
												<ul> <!-- <ul> and <li> creates an unordered list (bullet points)-->
												<li>This task is designed for preliminary Stage 6</li>
												<br>
												<li>allocated: 50mins</li>
												</ul>
												This activity is the conclusion of both activity 1 and activity 2 as students will use both their sketches and completed CAD models to create an advertisement infographic poster that showcases all their components from the first two activities.
												<br>
												<br>
												Students will then spend the last 15 minutes anonymously voting for their favourite advertisement, and the winner will win "funding" (a prize).
											</p>
											<br>
											<h3>Outcomes Assessed:</h3>
											<p>
												P1.1 examines design theory and practice, and considers the factors affecting designing and producing in design projects 
												<br>
												<br>
												P3.1 investigates and experiments with techniques in creative and collaborative approaches in designing and producing
												<br>
												<br>
												P4.3 evaluates the processes and outcomes of designing and producing
												<br>
												<br>
												P5.2 communicates ideas and solutions using a range of techniques 
												<br>
												<br>
												P5.3 uses a variety of research methods to inform the development and modification of design ideas 
												<br>
												<br>
												P6.1 investigates a range of manufacturing and production processes and relates these to aspects of design projects
												<br>
												<br>
												â€‹P6.2 evaluates and uses computer-based technologies in designing and producing

											<p style="text-align:center"> <!-- style="text-align:center" = centres the text-->
											<ul>
												<b><li>Time allocated: 35mins</li></b>
												<br>
												You will be tasked to create an infographic that advertises your brand new product to the world. In this infographic you must include your sketches and your CAD model as the progress of different stages of developement must be shown! This infographic must fit the size of an A3 sheet of paper and additionally with your progress of development, also include the rationale behind this product, and what does this product aim to solve.
												<br>
												<br>
												This infographic can be created on the website "Canva" which can be found below in the resources section, as this saves a lot of time due to the website providing a lot of high quality templates to use for free!
												<br>
												<br>
												<b><li>Time allocated: 15mins</li></b>
												Once you have completed the infographic, you will upload it to Google Classroom. Once uploaded, you will recieve a feedback form (found in the scaffold section below) which will be used to anonymously vote for a winner (you cannot vote for yourself). Whoever is crowned the winner will recieve "funding" (a prize) towards their product to be developed further.

											<h3>AITSL Standards:</h3>
											<p class="LessonContent">
												Standard 2.6 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) - This standard is used by students engaging in research in different types of media and also the presentation of the students final work is based in a heavily ICT grounded concept (infographic).
												<br>
												<br>
												Standard 5.3 Make consistent and comparable judgements - This standard is used as students will provide diagnostic asssessment of themselves and their peers via the use of the feedback form and infographic submission, which allow for the teacher to adjust later lessons if needed based on the data gathered.
